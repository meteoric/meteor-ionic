# meteor-ionic

### Build [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) apps in [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/)!

This is an attempt at **real Ionic and Meteor integration**. This isn't only a wrapper [Ionic's CSS framework](http://ionicframework.com/docs/components/), it's also an (almost) complete port of [Ionic’s Angular directives](http://ionicframework.com/docs/api/) to [Meteor Blaze](https://www.meteor.com/blaze) templates.

## Why?
[Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) is arguably the most comprehensive, polished, cross-platform mobile framework available. But unfortunately a large portion of its functionality comes from Angular directives. [I'm not a fan of trying to force-fit Angular into Meteor](https://medium.com/space-camp/your-meteor-app-probably-doesnt-need-angular-13986a0323f6), so I wanted to see if I could rewrite Ionic specifically for Meteor.

## Getting started Guide
Check out the [GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md) for a guide on how to get started.

## Status

**Beta** See the TODO section below to see which Angular Directives have been ported to Blaze.

## Dependencies
Rather than include compiled or CDN versions of Ionic's CSS Framework we’ve extraced it into two separate packages:

- [meteoric:ionicons-sass](http://github.com/meteoric/ionicons-sass) Ionic’s Ionicons set wrapped for Meteor.
- [meteoric:ionic-sass](http://github.com/meteoric/ionic-sass) The base Ionic CSS Framework wrapped for Meteor.

## Examples

### Contacts App
A simple CRUD app to manage contacts.

[Demo](http://meteoric-contacts.meteor.com) |  [Code](https://github.com/meteoric/contacts)

### Meteor Hunt
A [Product Hunt](http://producthunt.com) clone built in Meteor Ionic. (In Progress)

### Demo of all components
